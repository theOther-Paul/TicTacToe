# TicTacToe

This is recreation of the popular tictactoe paper game in a terminal form

By the end, the game will contain:

- a functional game loop;
- basic menus with user interaction;
- ascii art for various stages of the game;
- 2 modes: vs player 2 and vs CPU

vs. CPU mode will be a pre-programmed combination of moves in order to win or drag the game into a draw
