		This is an interpretation of the Classic TicTacToe game, where 2 players duel in a 4x4 square matrix.
		The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid.
		To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3 - by - 3 or 4 - by - 4.
		In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing 'X' always goes first menu. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board
		until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled.
		If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os,
		then the game is a draw.
